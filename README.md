# sign-language

This project showcases a real-time sign language recognition system leveraging deep learning and computer vision. It is designed to interpret hand gestures with high accuracy and deliver quick responses for a smooth user experience.

Key Features:

 High Accuracy: Achieves over 90% accuracy in recognizing hand gestures using a custom-trained CNN model.

 Fast Response: Deployed via a Flask-based REST API backend with response times under 200ms.

 Interactive Frontend: React-based user interface allows seamless real-time gesture recognition and interaction.

This project aims to bridge communication gaps by converting sign language into readable text or speech in real time.
